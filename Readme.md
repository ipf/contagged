# Contagged

This extension parses your content to tag, replace and link specific terms. It is useful to auto-generate a glossary - but not only. See 'ChangeLog' and WiKi (http://wiki.typo3.org/index.php/Contagged).

In addition to the original functionality this provides links to all pages with the keyword in single view.
